# Random NRIC Generator

This is a simple web application made using React, and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/). <br/>
When the button to `generate NRIC` is clicked a unique NRIC will be generated. <br/>
The generated NRICs will be added to a table which will appear once a NRIC is generated. <br/>
The table has a pagination function and has a limit of 20/page as per default. When at least 50 NRIC is generated, the option of displaying the NRICs an option to display 10, 20, 50, or 100 per page will appear.
